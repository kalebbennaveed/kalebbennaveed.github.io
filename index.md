    <h1><strong>Kaleb</strong> Ben Naveed</h1>
    <p><strong>PhD Student</strong> in Robotics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>

    <p>I am a third-year Robotics Ph.D. student in The DASC Lab at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor Dimitra Panagou. My goal is to develop principled planning algorithms that enable long-term autonomy in robotic systems. My research is at the intersection of informative path planning, multi-agent coordination, and safe trajectory planning under uncertainty and disturbances, and is motivated by challenges in persistent exploration, reconstruction, and mapping in dynamic spatiotemporal environments. </p>

    <p>Previously, I worked with Professor John Dolan at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, on learning-based trajectory planning using reinforcement learning, and with Professor Sebastian Scherer on autonomy algorithms for reconnaissance missions. Previously, I have studied at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Cambridge.</p>
