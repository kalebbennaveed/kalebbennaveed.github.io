    <h1><strong>Kaleb</strong> <span class="normal-weight">Ben Naveed</span></h1>
    <p><strong>PhD Student</strong> in Robotics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>

    <p>I am a fourth-year Robotics Ph.D. student in
  <a href="https://dasc-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">The DASC Lab</a>
  at the
  <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Robotics</a>,
  advised by
  <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~dpanagou/" target="_blank">Professor Dimitra Panagou</a>. My goal is to develop principled planning algorithms that enable safe long-term autonomy in robotic systems. My research is at the intersection of informative path planning, multi-agent coordination, and safe trajectory planning under uncertainty and disturbances, and is motivated by challenges in persistent exploration, reconstruction, and mapping in dynamic spatiotemporal environments. </p>

<p>
  In the past, I have worked with 
  <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/" target="_blank">Professor John Dolan</a>
  at the 
  <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</a>,
  on trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles using model-free reinforcement learning, and with 
  <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/" target="_blank">Professor Sebastian Scherer</a>
  on autonomy algorithms for reconnaissance missions. I have previously studied at 
  <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>
   and the 
  <a href="https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I was also a 
  <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholar (RISS)</a> in 2020 and 2021.
