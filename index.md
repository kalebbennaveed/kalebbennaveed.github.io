    <h1><strong>Kaleb</strong> Ben Naveed</h1>
    <p><strong>PhD Student</strong> in Robotics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>

    <p>I am a third-year Robotics Ph.D. student in
  <a href="https://dasc-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">The DASC Lab</a>
  at the
  <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Robotics</a>,
  advised by
  <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~dpanagou/" target="_blank">Professor Dimitra Panagou</a>. My goal is to develop principled planning algorithms that enable long-term autonomy in robotic systems. My research is at the intersection of informative path planning, multi-agent coordination, and safe trajectory planning under uncertainty and disturbances, and is motivated by challenges in persistent exploration, reconstruction, and mapping in dynamic spatiotemporal environments. </p>

    <p>In the past, I have worked with 
    <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/" target="_blank">Dr. John Dolan</a>.
     at the 
     <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</a>, 
     on learning-based trajectory planning using reinforcement learning, and with 
     <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/" target="_blank">Dr. Sebastian Scherer</a> on autonomy algorithms for reconnaissance missions. I have previously studied at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the University of Cambridge. I have also been a 
     <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholar (RISS)</a>  in 2020 and 2021</p>
